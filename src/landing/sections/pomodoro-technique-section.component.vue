  <p>Pomoapp makes it easy to use the Pomodoro technique.</p>

  <blockquote>
    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
    Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down
    work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by
    short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English
    of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen
    timer that Cirillo used as a university student. -
